            사랑해요
          </header>
          <p> I love you with all my heart, more than you could ever imagine. I want nothing more than to be with you. I know I'm a pain in the ass sometimes. More often I'd like to be, because honestly all I want is to make your life easier. Even though, sometimes I'm aware I do the opposite. Regardless of that, I've never had a thought where I wanted to stress you on purpose or make you feel bad (other than playfully in games ofc teehee). You're the most special person to me, and I am so genuinely in love with you. I want you so bad and I'm so lucky to have you. I have a girl who doesn't lie to me, loves me, and is to some degree crazy about me (will cut my dick off if I take too long to text her back teehee). 
          </p>
          <p>  I hope one day I'll help you believe in love again, and that you'll be in as much love with me as I am with you. I have made this promise a lot. But I promise that I'll always try to be a better partner, friend, and person in your life overall. To learn to love and understand you the way you want to be loved and understood. I don't mind putting in that effort, because I know that you do it. I love you, I say it a lot but I mean it more every time I do. I love every bit of you, your heart, your mind, your soul, your body, your face, the way you find a saying every now and then and stick to it for a while, the way you dress, the way always look so cute whenever you take a selfie, sometimes you scrunch your nose, the way that you laugh, the way you talk, the way you think, the way that you always try to be as selfless as you can, the way that you really do try your hardest in things, the way that you can recall the lore of so many games and explain them to me (I love sitting there just listening to you talk), and honestly, the list goes on and on. I love so many things about you, my silver girlie, and even those that I'm not fond of, I always try to take the time to learn to love and accept them, sometimes it just takes me a bit longer. 
          </p>
          <p>
            P.S. I know we've had a rough time lately, but I want you to know that leaving isn't an option for me. I'd rather argue and communicate a thousand times with you to keep going than to start over with someone else. I love you with every bit of me.
